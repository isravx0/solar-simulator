# Solar Panel Simulator

An interactive web application that allows users to simulate the expected energy output of solar panels.  
By entering parameters such as number of panels, tilt angle, location, and usage pattern, the tool estimates annual production and savings.  
Results are displayed in clear charts and can be exported to CSV for further analysis.

⚠️ Note: This is a *simulation* — results are estimates and not guaranteed to be 100% accurate.
